# Toolkit
Various and sundry small programs and scripts to work with the data we collect.

- levenshtein: 2 simple programs to calculate Levenshtein edit distance matrix for a set of keywords
- parse_mitmdump: I had no idea what the dump format of mitmproxy was, so I just wrote my own parser for it.
- spit_mitm_chunks: package mitmdump output stream for batch processing (so that web mining speed and processing speed can be decoupled) 
- plonk_in_mongodb: store unprocessed JSON in a (possibly remote) MongoDB database for off-line analysis
