Found an ERROR in the coop201712 input set
on line 151919

duplicate
            },
            },

which translates to an empty record *without gtin*
(so that the gtin and the product tables run askew)

There are still 14 records "unknown_product"
and probably those cause that there's no gtin for 14 records
(4670 + 14 = 4684 records)

input blob has only 4670 '"Entity" records
so use that as record sep (except for the last one)
