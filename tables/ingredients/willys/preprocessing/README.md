# Ingredients/preprocessing
Scripts to convert ingredients lists to an ingredients table 
See also: ingredientslists

The script process_ingredients.sh works with a chain of preproccessing
filters on an input ingredients list.

symlinks in links.d determine which step comes next (idea from SYSVinit
initscripts)

This version is a modification of my original Coop code, especially
for Willys data.
