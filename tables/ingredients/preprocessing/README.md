# Ingredients/preprocessing
Scripts to convert ingredients lists to an ingredients table 
See also: ingredientslists

The script process_ingredients.sh works with a chain of preproccessing
filters on an input ingredients list.

symlinks in links.d determine which step comes next (idea from SYSVinit
initscripts)

We now have 11000 ingredients so the code is NOT FINISHED
