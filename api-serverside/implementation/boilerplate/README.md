We will need about a dozen tables "imported" into the API

maybe 30 or so including less important support tables

I think it's worth it to write boilerplate code.

boilerplate generated, not tested.

idea: to generate a function "verify_boilerplate" to test if
anything substantial has changed in the database that requires changes
in the EXISTING generated code
